## STAT 545A: Mini Data-Analysis
#### Tiana Broen (tbroen@mail.ubc.ca)
##### Welcome to my mini data-analysis! This repository contains all files and work pertaining to Milestone 1, 2, and 3 of the mini data anlaysis assignment. Each folder contains .rmd code, which can be run in rstudio, as well as a .md file for clearly viewing all of my results. See below for more detailed descriptions of each milestone.

### What is this project?
 - An independent mini-analysis using semi-tidy datasets that were designed for education purposes
 - We are given an option of seven data sets to work with from the *datateachr* package by Hayley Boyce and Jordan Bourak
 - The aim is to create clean, reproducible, and coherent analysis

#### Milestone 1
##### See files in *Milestone_1* folder
 - The first milestone has three main goals
      1. Become familiar with the dataset
      2. Think of four questions to answer with the dataset
      3. Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
 -Files in this Milestone: Milestone 1_TB.R; Milestone1_TianaBroen.Rmd; Milestone1_TianaBroen.md 

#### Milestone 2
##### See files in *Milestone_2* folder
 - This second milestone has four main goals:
      1. Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing data in tibbles
      2. Understand what tidy data is
      3. Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
      4. Gain an understanding of how to use R to answer research questions about data (my data: *apt_buildings*)
-Files in this Milestone: Milestone2_TB.Rmd, Milestone2_TB.Rmd

#### Milestone 3
##### See files in *Milestone_3* folder
-The third milestone has three main goals:
     1. Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
     2. Fitting a model object to your data, and extract a result.
     3. Reading and writing data as separate files.
-Files in this milestone: Milestone3_TB.Rmd, Milestone3_TB.md
